You are given an array consisting of positive integers.

A division of the array into one or more contiguous subarrays is considered "beautiful" if no two subarrays within a division contain the same number or in other word same numbers has to be in same subarray in division.

you have to return the total number of "beautiful" divison of array.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 possible beautiful divisions are: ([1], [2], [3]), ([1], [2,3]), ([1,2], [3]) ([1,2,3]).

Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible beautiful divisions is: ([2,2,2]).

Example 3:

Input: arr = [2,1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 possible beautiful divisions are: ([2,1,2], [4]) and ([2,1,2,4]).

Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
