You are given a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets. Your task is to compute the sum of all distinct characters in every possible substring of the string.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: str = "abcd"
output: 20
explanation: substring of length 1:"a","b","c","d" : 1+1+1+1 = 4
	     substring of length 2:"ab","bc","cd"  : 2+2+2 = 6
	     substring of length 3:"abc","bcd"     : 3+3 = 6
	     substring of length 4:"abcd"          : 4
	                                      total: 4+6+6+4 = 20
Example 2:
Input: str = "xyyzx"
output: 28


Constraints:
1 <= str.length <= 105
str consists of lowercase English letters.
